// The express.static() method is a built-in Express.js middleware function that can take all of the contents of a folder and serve them as static assets. This is useful for front-end specific files like images, style sheets, and JavaScript files.


// turn on routes
app.use(routes);

// turn on connection to db and server
sequelize.sync({ force: false }).then(() => {
  app.listen(PORT, () => console.log('Now listening'));
});

// Since we set up the routes the way we did, we don't have to worry about importing multiple files for different endpoints. The router instance in routes/index.js collected everything for us and packaged them up for server.js to use.

// The other thing to notice is the use of {force: false} in the .sync() method. This doesn't have to be included, but if it were set to true, it would drop and re-create all of the database tables on startup. This is great for when we make changes to the Sequelize models, as the database would need a way to understand that something has changed. We'll have to do that a few times throughout this project, so it's best to keep the {force: false} there for now.
